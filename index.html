		 Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, 
which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus Coffea is 
native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) 
and Madagascar, the Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.
The plant was exported from Africa to countries around the world. 
Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the 
equatorial regions of the Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. 
The two most commonly grown are arabica and robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries are picked, 
processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as beans) are roasted to varying degrees,
 depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and brewed with near-boiling water 
to produce coffee as a beverage.
Coffee is slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine content. 
Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the world.[3] It can be prepared and 
presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, café latte, etc.).
 It is usually served hot, although iced coffee is a popular alternative.
 Clinical studies indicate that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial 
in healthy adults, with continuing research on whether long-term consumption lowers the risk 
of some diseases, although there is generally poor quality of such studies.<p>
